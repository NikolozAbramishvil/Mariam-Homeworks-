     <h1> Vegetables  </h1>
     <p>They're nature's original desserts. And naturally sweet fruits are essential in protecting our bodies from disease.

        Eating at least one-and-a-half to two cups of diverse fruits every day can boost antioxidant activity. 
        Fruits are particularly abundant in anti-inflammatory compounds, 
        which are important in protecting our bodies from heart disease, diabetes,
         and certain forms of cancer and bowel disease. </p>
         <p>How to get enough healthful fruits in your diet? 
            One strategy is to eat with the seasons, choosing grapes and stone fruits in the summer, 
            apples and pears in the fall, persimmons and pomegranates in the winter,
             and citrus and cherries in the spring.</p>
           <p> While all fruits tend to be rich in disease-protective nutrients, some have received particular attention in the nutrition world for their anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>
