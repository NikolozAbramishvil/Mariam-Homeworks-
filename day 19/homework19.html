    <main> France,[a] officially the French Republic,[b] is a country located primarily in Western Europe. It also includes overseas regions and territories in the Americas and the Atlantic, 
        Pacific, and Indian Oceans,[XII] giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive economic zones in the world. 
        Metropolitan France shares borders with Belgium and Luxembourg to the north, Germany to the north east, Switzerland to the east, Italy and Monaco to the south east, Andorra and Spain to the south, and a maritime border with the United Kingdom to the north west. 
        Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea. 
        Its overseas territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean. 
        Its eighteen integral regions (five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi) and have a total population of 68.4 million as of January 2024.[5][8]
         France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre; 
        other major urban areas include Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, Lille, Bordeaux, Strasbourg, Nantes, and Nice.</main>
    

        <section> The Franks embraced the Christian Gallo-Roman culture, and ancient Gaul was renamed Francia ("Land of the Franks"). The Germanic Franks adopted Romanic languages. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian dynasty, but his kingdom would not survive his death. 
            The Franks treated land as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from that of Clovis: Paris, Orl√©ans, Soissons, and Rheims.
             The last Merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace (head of household).
             One mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated an Umayyad invasion of Gaul at the Battle of Tours (732).
             His son, Pepin the Short, seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the Carolingian dynasty.
             Pepin's son, Charlemagne, reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built an empire across Western and Central Europe.

            Proclaimed Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III and thus establishing the French government's longtime historical association with the Catholic Church,[41] Charlemagne tried to revive the Western Roman Empire and its cultural grandeur. 
            Charlemagne's son, Louis I kept the empire united, however in 843, it was divided between Louis' three sons, into East Francia, Middle Francia and West Francia. 
            West Francia approximated the area occupied by modern France and was its precursor.[42]</section>
