       <h1> New York</h1>

       <p>
        New York, also called New York State,[b] is a state in the Northeastern United States.
         One of the Mid-Atlantic states, it borders the Atlantic Ocean, New England, Canada, and the Great Lakes.
        [c] With almost 19.6 million residents, it is the fourth-most populous state in the United States and eighth-most densely populated as of 2023.[5] New York is the 27th-largest U.S. 
        state by area, with a total area of 54,556 square miles (141,300 km2).
        [2]

New York has a varied geography. 
The southeastern part of the state, known as Downstate, encompasses New York City, the United States' largest city; Long Island,
 the nation's most populous island; and the suburbs and wealthy enclaves of the lower Hudson Valley. 
These areas are the center of the New York metropolitan area,
 a sprawling urban landmass, and account for approximately two-thirds of the state's population.
 The much larger Upstate area spreads from the Great Lakes to Lake Champlain and includes the Adirondack Mountains and the Catskill Mountains (part of the wider Appalachian Mountains).
 The east–west Mohawk River Valley bisects the more mountainous regions of Upstate and flows into the north–south Hudson River valley near the state capital of Albany. 
Western New York, home to the cities of Buffalo and Rochester, is part of the Great Lakes region and borders Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. 
Central New York is anchored by the city of Syracuse;
 between the central and western parts of the state, New York is dominated by the Finger Lakes, a popular tourist destination. 
To the south, along the state border with Pennsylvania, 
the Southern Tier sits atop the Allegheny Plateau, representing the northernmost reaches of Appalachia.

<h2>   Statue of Liberty</h2>

<p>The Statue of Liberty National Monument is a United States National Monument comprising Liberty Island and Ellis Island in the U.S.
        states of New Jersey and New York.[5] It includes the 1886 Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World) by sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and the Statue of Liberty Museum,
         both situated on Liberty Island, as well as the former immigration station at Ellis Island which includes the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital.

       The monument is managed by the National Park Service as part of the National Parks of New York Harbor office. 


       The Statue of Liberty is a world-famous symbol of freedom, 
       given in 1886 by France to the United States in celebration of American Independence. Nearby Ellis Island was the first stop for millions of immigrants to the U.S. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[20] 
       The national monument recalls this period of massive immigration to the United States.[21]
